# GIF profile picture for Discord bots

This Python script leverages the Discord API to dynamically change your Discord bot's profile picture to a GIF with minimal effort.

**Prerequisites**

- Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- A Discord bot token (https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- A GIF file for the profile picture

**Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Skyy-Development/Discord-bot-animated-pfp.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd discord-bot-animated-pfp
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

**Interactive Setup**

The script will prompt you to enter your Discord bot token and the path to the GIF file you want to use. Ensure the GIF file is accessible within the project directory or provide the absolute path if it's located elsewhere.

Once the script executes successfully, your Discord bot's profile picture will be updated to the provided GIF. Now, your bot will stand out with a touch of animation!
